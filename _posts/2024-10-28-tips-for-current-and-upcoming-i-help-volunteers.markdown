Help is about giving back to society, helping the underprivileged, providing them with education they otherwise lack access to, and raising their voices. Volunteers at i-Help take on various roles, such as teaching, media PR and outreach, and human resources, all working together to support those in need. For people volunteering at i-Help for the first time, it can feel challenging. However, a few tips can help new volunteers overcome these obstacles and work more effectively.

Some tips for new volunteers at i-Help:

Since mentors assign work to volunteers, who are already experienced in their fields, volunteers should stay updated with relevant real-time resources and software to complete their tasks more efficiently.

Managing multiple tasks simultaneously can take time, so volunteers should practice punctuality and learn project and time management skills. It may be challenging at first, but once you have a plan, things become much easier.

Volunteers receive various tasks, so having a clear understanding of each assigned task will help avoid ambiguity when performing them.

For volunteers in Media PR and Outreach, understanding how to create posts, stories, and blogs for social media is essential to effectively raise awareness.

Teaching volunteers should have a solid grasp of teaching principles as they engage with students.

Communication plays a crucial role across all areas at i-Help. Volunteers should communicate effectively not only with mentors but also with the people they are helping, fostering empathy and compassion.

In conclusion, volunteering at i-Help allows participants to give back to society while developing new skillsets, broadening their perspectives, and building themselves up as they support others.
