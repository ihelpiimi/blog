The difference between urban and rural students are not in terms of intellect, but due to their surrounding environment, learning ability, availability of infrastructure, skills, and access to different facilities.
Considering these factors, the curriculum for rural students must be curated. But it is also equally important to ensure that students are taught in a manner that is easily comprehensible in their given capacity.
Currently, the dominant task of primary education in India is to universalize compulsory education, especially in rural areas. On this note, let’s look at the ways we can upgrade primary level education in rural regions to close the gap.
•	Access and quality of education must go hand in hand. Quality of education rests upon its infrastructural facilities such as classrooms, water and sanitation facilities, availability of electricity, provision for digital learning, sports equipment and facilities, availability of chairs and desks, access to books and learning materials, among others

•	The infrastructure in schools must also be maintained. The current initiatives of having smart classrooms in public schools could go a long way in addressing this need with features and facilities like digital content, broadcasting classes conducted by experienced teachers, interactive classes through video conferencing, etc.

•	An efficient teacher brings about all the difference to a child’s education. Teachers are key to ensuring that students get the required readings that keep their minds kindled for seeking proficiency. In fact, students’ like or dislike attending classes or interests in a particular subject can be developed because of their teacher and his/her quality of teaching.
•	In modern times, we see more digital tech making its way into the classroom. The introduction of technology to the classroom offers vast opportunities to enhance learning and improve data collection. Digital learning can also help develop critical thinking skills. This requires the installation of wi-fi and smart board equipment in classes.

At the end of the day, it is imperative that the government plays an important role in improving educational outcomes for both urban and rural students. Over the past years, we have seen priorities being set for empowering education to females all over the world, for the simple reason that girls deserve education no less than boys.
Take in consideration the schemes by the Arunachal Pradesh government. The Girl Hygiene Scheme aims to empower female students by providing sanitary napkins to adolescent girls on DBT Mode, and CM Vidya Scheme ensures Rs. 10000 to be deposited in every female student’s bank account who passes Class V.

Also, under Acharya Dronacharya Gurukul Yojana, meritorious students in class VI and class IX were given scholarships in the recent past. Similarly, career counseling facilities and a stipend of Rs. 5000 per month were given for science students studying outside Arunachal Pradesh. Under the scheme, 460 meritorious students were also given laptops to encourage them in the field of science in 2018. The scheme also promises 100% scholarship to meritorious students who seek to coach for civil service exams through ALS IAS academy at Itanagar.

There are certain things that can be improved in both urban and rural settings. Academic curriculums must also adapt to the needs of the learner, so that students are able to become the best version of themselves. On this note, academic textbooks and learning methodologies must be made interesting. For rural students, information related to their culture, traditions, and values can be incorporated into their textbooks to maintain their interest in studies.
To widen access to education, three pathways to learning should be considered, including formal, non-formal, and informal approaches. Also, career counselling should be provided to help students choose a field that is in sync with their skills and job expectations.
In conclusion, “Rural and urban schools are much the same when it comes to resources and learning environments” (EQR, 2003, p.45). But there are various variables that can affect individual students’ achievement. Enhancing the quality of education with career decision-making variables in both rural and urban sectors can considerably impact an individual’s ability to efficiently enhance individual well-being, become economically productive, develop sustainable livelihoods, contribute to peaceful, democratic societies and growth of employment opportunities.
