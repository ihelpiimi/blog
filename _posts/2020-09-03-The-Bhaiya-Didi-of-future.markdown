In my past two years of association with i-Help with several visits completed, every eye speaks a story that inspires and motivates me to do something better. 

During a visit to class 5 in the Umariya school where I was teaching them to introduce themselves in English, a phrase allowed me to interact with all of them individually asking about what they wanted to become in the future. I could sense a lot of emotions and a sense of inhibition to display their ambition amongst others. I took the opportunity and asked each one of them to speak-up confidently about their aspirations and hopes. Some confident bunch of kids started speaking one by one on the top of their voice with full confidence about their ambition to become a doctor, businessman, engineer, teacher, actor and what not. 

But a girl in the corner grabbed my attention. I was forced to ask her what she wanted to become in the future. She was a bit hesitant at first, but after her friends supported her to speak-up, she gained up all the courage and said, "I want to become a Didi in the future". To which everyone started laughing, and I was not able to understand what she meant by it. After I asked the class to be quiet and not laugh at it, I asked her what she meant by it, and _**"I want to be the Didi to small kids as you are the Bhaiya to all of us"**_ was her reply. I then interjected, saying that she wanted to be a teacher as I thought she might be lacking the vocabulary. She quickly interrupted me saying, "No, I want to become Didi. You are not our teacher. You are the Bhaiya to us, and all the bhaiya-didi of IIM not only teaches us the subjects but informs us of something or the other interesting thing every time they visit. You call us to IIM do play sports, do drama on stage and everything that I wanted to do. You not only teach us, but you all also motivate us to do something good, my elder brother cleared NMMS because of your help, and everyone in our family is pleased about it. I want to be just like you and help small children, once I grow older and motivate them to do something which they feel is impossible to them".

It took me time to comprehend all of it, and the first thought that hit me was if we deserve this much amount of love, affection and respect. But that visit completely changed my outlook towards the organisations. I added to my contributions to the organisation as much as I could and made sure to go for every visit scheduled. Now, whenever I feel If my efforts are impacting anyone, I refer to this incident and start working in my best potential.
