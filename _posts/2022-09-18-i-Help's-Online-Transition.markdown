**'A child who does not receive an education is compared to a bird who does not have wings.'**

Before volunteering for i-Help, I hadn't given it much thought. I heard about its operations as soon as I entered IIM Indore. Still, I didn't get a grasp of its impact on the environment.

I volunteered for it because many others in my batch had already signed up for it. I had never given thought that it would be such a memorable experience.

Regrettably, because of the pandemic caused by COVID-19, the only option available was to take classes online. As a result, the online mode's overall teaching experience was negatively impacted by the online mode. We had to teach the kids on a different platform and ensure they were not lagging in comprehending the concepts.

I was thinking about the operations going online. Still, at the same time, the question encircling my mind was the feasibility of gadgets and tech for underprivileged students. Students from specific backgrounds could not afford the facilities all over the country. The same applied here too. There were a few obstacles, such as poor internet connectivity, among other things.

But then the i-Help team helped us solve the sameâ€”the team connected to the parents of the students. We assumed at least one household would have a smartphone and decent connectivity. That worked in 80% of the chances concerning our students.

We connected through Zoom calls, or WhatsApp Video calls to teach the students alongside showing them the screen (our blackboard substitute). In the worst case, we would record our classes and send them to the student to use once the internet connectivity stabilized.

Despite all these sudden changes in teaching, the student did her absolute best to comprehend the material presented in the online class and turned in her assignments on time. This inspired me to perform to the best of my abilities.

Despite the numerous challenges presented by the transition to the online medium, the i-Help team exerted tremendous effort to ensure that the process continued as usual. As a result, I deeply admire their dedication to this endeavor.

I felt a sense of accomplishment for being a part of and contributing positively to i-Help. When I did something that had the potential to make a significant impact on the life of another person, I felt such overwhelming joy.
