**'A child without education is like a bird without wings.'**

~ A Famous Tibetan Proverb

Before volunteering for i-Help, I hadn't given it much thought. 

I volunteered for it because many others in my batch had already signed up for it. Never would I have imagined it to be such a memorable experience.

Regrettably, because of the pandemic caused by COVID-19, the only option available to the volunteers was to take online classes. As a result, the overall teaching experience was negatively impacted. We, the volunteers, had to find different ways to teach in order to ensure that the students were able to comprehend the concepts.

Still, at the same time, the question encircling my mind was the feasibility of gadgets and technology for underprivileged students. Students from specific backgrounds could not afford the facilities all over the country. The same applied here too. There were a few obstacles, such as poor internet connectivity, among other things.

The i-Help team helped us resolve this issue by connecting with the students' parents. The team checked if each student's household had at least one smartphone and decent internet connectivity. This worked in 80% of the cases.

The i-Help team came with the idea to connect through Zoom calls, or WhatsApp Video calls to teach the students alongside showing them the screen (our blackboard substitute). Whenever the students faced connectivity issues, we would record the lectures and send it to them to use once the internet connectivity is stabilized.

Despite the sudden change in the mode of teaching, the student did her absolute best to comprehend the concepts taught and turned in her assignments on time. This motivated me to do my level best.

Despite the numerous challenges presented by the transition to the online medium, the i-Help team exerted tremendous effort to ensure that the process continued as usual. As a result, I deeply admire their dedication to this endeavor.

Being a part of i-Help, I felt a sense of accomplishment and pride. Doing something which might potentially make a big difference in someone's life gave me overwhelming joy. A famous Tibetan proverb rightly says, 'A child without education is like a bird without wings'. I am thankful to i-Help for giving me this opportunity and giving these children, their wings.
