To empower underprivileged school children with primary and secondary education by guiding students in cracking scholarship exams like NTSE, NMMS, and Navodya, i-Help undertakes its operations with pride and devotion. Letâ€™s examine in detail the scholarship exams that i-Help prepares its students for:

NTSE

The National Talent Search Examination (NTSE) is one of the most esteemed scholarships in India. The NTSE test is renowned for its examination standards and well- designed question papers. Students undergo a two-part assessment procedure. The Mental Ability Test (Stage 1) evaluates students' deductive thinking and problem-solving capacity. Math, Science, and Geography questions are included on the Scholastic Aptitude Test (Stage 2). Students who qualify in stage 1 can appear for the stage 2 assessment. Both papers consist of 100 questions for 1 point each, and students are given two hours to complete them. An NTSE Scholar is entitled to a scholarship of Rs 1250/- a month in Class XI and XII. It increases to Rs 2000/- a month in undergraduate and post-graduate courses. An NTSE scholar also gets a scholarship for Ph.D. as per the UGC norms.

NMMS

The Central Government offers the NMMS (National Merit-cum-Means Scholarship) examination for Class 8 students interested in acquiring financial help for their
secondary education. The initiative was started in May 2008 for academically gifted children from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. The application period for the NMMS Scholarship examination runs typically from July to December. Its objective is to encourage kids to continue their education and lower the dropout rate in Classes 8 and 9, raising India's total literacy rate. INR 12,000 worth of the NMMS Scholarship for four years will be deposited as INR 1000 monthly for students who qualify for the exam. The NMMS exam comprises two sections - The mental ability section and the scholastic aptitude section.

JNVST

JNVST (Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya Selection Test) is the test held for class VI admission in Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas throughout the country's 28 states and seven union territories. The Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti administers this exam to select the best students to attend JNV schools in India. The children gain access to quality government schools and a good standard of education by clearing the exam. Each Navodaya Vidyalaya is a co-educational residential institution providing free boarding and lodging, free school uniforms, textbooks, stationery, and to and fro rail and bus fare to students. Currently, there are 661 Navodaya schools. 80 Class VI students may be admitted based on this screening test for each Vidyalaya. The exam is given at the start of the year, and the admittance year's JNVST results are typically made public by the end of May. The exam provides gifted students from rural locations access to high-quality education and serves as a focal point for education across the nation's districts.
