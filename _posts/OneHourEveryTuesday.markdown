It is Tuesday. Even after 6 hours of continuous lectures, my day is not yet over. No, I am not talking about my assignments. Instead, I am supposed to teach 3 bright students Mathematics for their National Talent Search Examination preparation.

When I was first told that I was to teach NTSE aspirants, I was a bit skeptical, for I was quite out of practice with the material. Regardless, I gathered myself, reviewed the material for the day in brief. I contacted the students and set up a time to meet through google meet. Looking back, I am not quite sure what I expected, but without a shred of doubt, my experience teaching them was far more positive than whatever my expectations were. I was supposed to teach for one hour, and according to my clock, I did not teach for much longer, but to me, it felt far longer. The students were clearly not satisfied with me just providing them the formulas for them to apply. Their curiosity ran far deeper, and I had to spend quite a bit of time explaining them the why and how behind the formulas. 

The first day, I was disappointed and a bit worried at not being able to cover all the problems provided in the materials. After about half an hour, I realized that my worries were in vain, for I received text messages from all of my students, either asking me to check their solutions or letting me know about the problems theyâ€™ve faced. By the next day, all of them had completed most the of problems I was not able to cover last day. I do not know about others, but I for sure was not this dedicated myself. 

In a way, this dedication has inspired me to do my best myself, to help them. It is clear to me that these are extremely bright students, with huge potential. All they need is some guidance. The short hour I spend with them leads to noticeable improvement in their abilities. I can take no credit for this. It is because the activeness of these students in asking questions and clearing up little doubts in their conceptual understandings that our short sessions end up being so productive. They are not just interested in doing well in the NTSE, but they are equally interested in learning.

Looking back, I am not quite sure what I expected, but without a shred of doubt, I did not expect to learn so much myself.
