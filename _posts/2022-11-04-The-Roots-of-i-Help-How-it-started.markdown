How does something big and successful get created?

It is often a result of a small step by someone who dared to dream, think differently, and bring about a change.

A visit to the rural areas around Indore to study and understand the problems of the denizens and prepare a project report was the task set for the IPM students that term back in 2012. While everyone collected data to understand the various problems faced by the people, one boy questioned if the students could help resolve the problems of underprivileged children.

And that is how i-Help was born – as a student-run initiative to help improve the mathematical and linguistic ability of the children and help them prepare for scholarship exams. The professors were interested in helping take the idea forward as it served a noble cause. The first step they decided would be to visit the under-privileged-yet-eager children during the weekends and teach them basic arithmetic and verbal ability. And in the subsequent years, it expanded to teaching the kids scholarship exams. Soon, i-Help also had four wings – Academic, Human Resources and Operations, Media and Public Relations, and a Projects Team – to perform various functions effectively and increase the reach of i-Help’s operations.

Since then, i-Help has come a long way – growing in size, the scale of operations, and vision. But the focus has always been on the dreams we could help fulfill and the smiles we could help bring to the kids’ faces. Cheers to a more significant cause!!
