Audio visual aid in learning is a form of instruction where comprehension and retention of a particular topic is increased by introducing audio and visual presentation of the material. As this form of learning employs more than one sense therefore the children or even adults are able to learn and retain the information presented to them better. For example, you can remember things that you see for a longer time compared to those that you have only heard and this method of teaching can involve both therefore it is much more effective than our conventional method of teaching. 
In India, we can observe that the students struggle with understanding topics and they just simply mug up their prescribed texts. This issue is prevalent in most of the schools in India. One of the major reason for this is lack of good teachers, this leads to children not understanding things that are taught to them and end up simply mugging everything up. The solution to this can be audio-visual aids, they enhance teacher's ability to present the lesson in simple, effective and easy to understand for the students. Also this can be an effective solution for a large scale easily, if one good video explaining a topic is made then that can be used across all schools. Another problem that students face is concentrating during lectures. If a teacher simply reads out from a book, all the students might find it hard to concentrate continuously on it but in its place if they are asked to see a video on the same thing with animations and sound effects, it will help them focus much more compared to normal readings. Use of audio visual aids improves student's critical and analytical thinking because they get better understanding of the topics. It helps to remove abstract concepts through visual presentation.
There is a strong need to implement audio visual aids in all the schools of the country. A lot of schools in the country are already using these methods and can see the results clearly. Implementing this in all schools will give each child of this country a chance to actually learn and be educated rather than just mug up to pass for exams.
