At i-Help, we associate with various schools and NGOs to encourage, promote, and inculcate education in the lives of those who are unfortunately unable to access such resources. We offer different volunteer positions for volunteers to work in and provide to the best of their abilities. I-Help provides opportunities for volunteers to work in areas such as Human Resources, Media, PR, outreach, and Teaching.

### Hard skills: 
Volunteers gain experience in working with real-time resources and software. They are assigned work and are led by competent mentors well-versed in the field. Volunteers are encouraged to be creative and provided with multiple opportunities to perform and refine their skills. In the Media, PR, and Outreach team, volunteers are expected to develop an understanding of how to create posts and stories for social media platforms like Instagram and LinkedIn. They also understand the principles of teaching when they participate in visits.

### Soft skills:
Participants are provided with regular deadlines and thus learn the essential ideas of punctuality, dedication and project management. Volunteers are expected to communicate with the underprivileged from different backgrounds and as a result, they develop a sense of empathy and compassion. Moreover, a good deal of projects are team-based and thus volunteers learn teamwork and leadership.

All volunteers at i-Help are involved in imparting knowledge in one way or the other. The key takeaway is that an i-Help volunteer not only works for the social motive but also they learn a skill set that is useful in real life. I-Help volunteers are energetic, empathetic, and envisioning individuals who are self-determined to perform for the cause of the less fortunate.
